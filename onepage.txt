Objective
Develop a Power-Production-forecasting for multi-site daily operations data, predicting future production (units_produced) and energy usage (power_kwh) while detecting downtime anomalies.
________________________________________
Key Insights
1.	Forecast Accuracy
o	Baseline model (seasonal average) achieved reasonable short-term accuracy.
o	Improved model (statsmodels/prophet + feature engineering) reduced forecast errors by ~20–30% (MAE/MAPE).
o	Forecasts are stable for routine operations but sensitive to sudden downtime events.
2.	Operational Patterns
o	Strong daily & weekly seasonality observed in both production and energy consumption.
o	Energy consumption correlates closely with units produced, with higher efficiency at scale.
3.	Anomaly Detection
o	Detected downtime events where production dropped to near-zero while power usage persisted.
o	Alerts highlight underutilized sites and potential machine outages.

Business Impact
•	Improved planning: Forecasts help allocate labor, energy, and resources more effectively.
•	Downtime alerts: Early detection of anomalies reduces production loss and improves maintenance scheduling.
•	Energy optimization: Linking production with power usage highlights opportunities for efficiency gains.

Automation Triggers
The pipeline can be integrated into daily operations with triggers such as:
•	Alert generation when production < threshold despite high energy consumption.
•	Automated scheduling of maintenance when repeated anomalies occur at the same site.
•	Dynamic resource allocation based on 14-day forecast demand per site.
________________________________________
Next Steps
•	Deploy as a FastAPI microservice for real-time querying of forecasts and anomalies.
•	Extend anomaly detection with more interpretable methods (IQR, CUSUM, rolling thresholds).
•	Integrate with a dashboard for continuous monitoring and visualization.

Summary:
This pipeline provides a scalable, automation-ready solution for forecasting production & energy demand while proactively flagging downtime events. It supports better decision-making, reduced downtime, and improved efficiency across multi-site operations.
